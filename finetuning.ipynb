To give you the best advice, I need a little more context. \n\nTell me, what specifically are you feeling stressed about?  For example: \n\n* **Is it about the content itself?** Do you feel unprepared for certain topics or concepts? \n* **Is it about the exam format?** Are you worried about multiple-choice questions, essays, or other types of assessment?\n* **Is it about time management?**  Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to cover?\n* **Is it about your performance?** Are you concerned about not doing well enough or not meeting your own expectations?\n\nOnce I understand your specific concerns, I can offer more tailored advice.
